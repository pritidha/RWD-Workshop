            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
            but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
             or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. 
             If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
              sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
              All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined 
              chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
              It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of 
              model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
               The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, 
               injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.



               Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
                it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                 Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                  obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                  and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                  discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
                  1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The 
                  Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                  This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                   during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem

                                                     Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
                                                      has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making 
                                                      it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                                                       Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more
                                                        obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                                                        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                                                        discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 
                                                        1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The 
                                                        Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. 
                                                        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular
                                                         during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem 
                                                         ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                        
                                                         There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, 
                                                         but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
                                                          or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. 
                                                          If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
                                                           sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. 
                                                           All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined 
                                                           chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. 
                                                           It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of 
                                                           model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.
                                                            The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, 
                                                            injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
